          The new local storage mode is more pure and simpler. It allows building your system without access to the
          (yubi)key, for example in a CI environment. Depending on your threat-model it might be considered less secure,
          especially when your repo is public and one your host-keys leaks. Visit the README (https://github.com/oddlama/agenix-rekey)
          and search check the section on 'Storage Modes' for more information.

          To keep the old behavior, select "derivation". This message will be removed end of 2024 so we can choose an upstream default.

          You have the choice between two storage modes for your rekeyed secrets, which
          are fundamentally different from each other. You can freely switch between them at any time.

          Option one is to store the rekeyed secrets locally in your repository (`local`), option two is to
          transparently store them in a derivation that will be created automatically (`derivation`).
          If in doubt use `local` which is more flexible and pure, but keep in mind that `derivation`
          can be more secure for certain cases. It uses more "magic" to hide some details and might be
          simpler to use if you only build on one host and don't care about remote building / CI.
          The choice depends on your organizational preferences and threat model.

          **derivation**: Previously this was the default mode. All rekeyed secrets for each host will
            be collected in a derivation which copies them to the nix store when it is built using `agenix rekey`.

            Pro: The entire process is stateless and rekeyed secrets are never committed to your repository.
            Con: You cannot easily build your host from a CI/any host that hasn't access to your (yubi)key
                 except by manually uploading the derivations to the CI after rekeying.

          **local**: All rekeyed secrets will be saved to a local folder in your flake when running `agenix rekey`.
            Agenix will use these local files directly, without requiring any extra derivations. This is the simpler
            approach and has less edge-cases.

            Pro: System building stays pure, no need for sandbox shenanigans. -> System can be built without access to the (yubi)key.
            Con: If your repository is public and one of your hosts is compromised, an attacker may decrypt
                 any secret that was ever encrypted for that host. This includes secrets that are in the git history.

          This is the directory where we store the rekeyed secrets
          so that they can be found later by the derivation builder.

          Must be a bash expression that expands to the directory to use
          as a cache. By default the cache is kept in /tmp, but you can
          change it (see example) to persist the cache across reboots.
          The directory must be readable by the nix build users. Make
          sure to use corret quoting, this _must_ be a bash expression
          resulting in a single string.

          The actual secrets will be stored in the directory based on their input
          content hash (derived from host pubkey and file content hash), and stored
          as `''${cacheDir}/secrets/<ident-sha256>-<filename>`. This allows us to
          reuse already existing rekeyed secrets when rekeying again, while providing
          a deterministic path for each secret.

          If set, this will force that all secrets are rekeyed on a system of the given architecture.
          This is important if you have several hosts with different architectures, since you usually
          don't want to build the derivation containing the rekeyed secrets on a random remote host.

          The problem is that each derivation will always depend on at least one specific architecture
          (often it's bash), since it requires a builder to create it. Usually the builder will use the
          architecture for which the package is built, which makes sense. Since it is part of the derivation
          inputs, we have to know it in advance to predict where the output will be. If you have multiple
          architectures, then we'd have multiple candidate derivations for the rekeyed secrets, but we want
          a single predictable derivation.

          If you would try to deploy an aarch64-linux system, but are on x86_64-linux without binary
          emulation, then nix would have to build the rekeyed secrets using a remote builder (since the
          derivation then requires aarch64-linux bash). This option will override the pkgs set passed to
          the derivation such that it will use a builder of the specified architecture instead. This way
          you can force it to always require a x86_64-linux bash, thus allowing your local system to build it.

          The "automatic" and nice way would be to set this to builtins.currentSystem, but that would
          also be impure, so unfortunately you have to hardcode this option.

          HINT: If you want to use a path, make sure to use an actual nix path, so for example

          Alternatively you can use `readFile "/path/to/host.pub"` yourself.

          The list of age identities that will be presented to `rage` when decrypting the stored secrets
          to rekey them for your host(s). If multiple identities are given, they will be tried in-order.

          The recommended options are:

          - Use a split-identity ending in `.pub`, where the private part is not contained (a yubikey identity)
          - Use an absolute path to your key outside of the nix store ("/home/myuser/age-master-key")
          - Or encrypt your age identity and use the extension `.age`. You can encrypt an age identity
            using `rage -p -o privkey.age privkey` which protects it in your store.

          If you are using YubiKeys, you can specify multiple split-identities here and use them interchangeably.
          You will have the option to skip any YubiKeys that are not available to you in that moment.

          To prevent issues with master keys that may be sometimes unavailable during encryption,
          an alternate syntax is possible:

          ```nix
          age.rekey.masterIdentities = [
            {
              # This has the same type as the other ways to specify an identity.
              identity = ./password-encrypted-identity.pub;
              # Optional; This has the same type as `age.rekey.hostPubkey`
              # and allows explicit association of a pubkey with the identity.
              pubkey = "age1qyqszqgpqyqszqgpqyqszqgpqyqszqgpqyqszqgpqyqszqgpqyqs3290gq";
            }
          ];
          ```

          If a pubkey is explicitly specified, it will be used
          in place of the associated identity during encryption. This prevents additional prompts
          in the case of a password encrypted key file or prompts for identities that can only be accessed
          by certain people in a multi-user scenario. For Yubikey identities the pubkey can be automatically
          extracted from the identity file, if there is a comment of the form `Recipient: age1yubikey1<key>`
          present in the identity file.
          This should be the case for identity files generated by the `age-plugin-yubikey` CLI.
          See the description of [pull request #28](https://github.com/oddlama/agenix-rekey/pull/28)
          for more information on the exact criteria for automatic pubkey extraction.

          For setups where the primary identity may change depending on the situation, e.g. in a multi-user setup,
          where each person only has access to their own personal Yubikey, check out the
          `AGENIX_REKEY_PRIMARY_IDENTITY` environment variable.

          Be careful when using paths here, as they will be copied to the nix store. Using
          split-identities is fine, but if you are using plain age identities, make sure that they
          are password protected.
